20th April 2020: 

The world is currently in lockdown with the Covid-19 virus. A plus side of the lockdown is that I now have a lot of extra time to persue personal projects I have thought about for a while. Building myself a website seems like a great place to start! 

I've previously helped someone build a website using Wix. It was a solid editor and a great tool, but there are a lot of layers of extraction from the raw editing of the website. I want something a bit more gritty and hands on. I listen to the Podcast [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) by Jack Rhysider, he talks about fascinating Cyber Security scandals and hacks (I reccomend giving it a listen). In one episode he talked about how he build himself a website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Jack mentioned that Jekyll provided a means of creating a lightweight website that is entirely HTML with no backends and databases to get in to. Now, I'm not too worried about anyone trying to get into the website, but what caught my attention was the fact that Jekyll allowed you to create a website completely from scratch, with a bit of ruby terminal magic and some Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS. You could even host the website through github without having to pay a penny. I know absolutely nothing about this side or space of software development, so naturally I thought it would be perfect to try something new.

I followed a few simple steps on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) website, then watched a great [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&feature=emb_title) by the wizards [Mike Dane](https://www.mikedane.com/). 

I spent some time scouting for a theme that I liked and thought would work well with what I'm trying to achieve from this website.

I'm looking for something to mainly serve as a portfolio about myself, but I would also like to occaisionally blog about personal projects, things I've learnt from work, and tutorials or guides.

I've gone with the [developr-jekyll](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll) theme by [Sunjay Kundu](https://sujaykundu.com/#/).
