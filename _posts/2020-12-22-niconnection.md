### NI Connections
NI Connections in part with Invest NI ran a campaign interviewing returned NI diaspora in an effort to attract further diaspora back to NI.   

After living in England, America and Australia for seven years I was pleasently surprised with the Northern Ireland I returned to and was happy to sit down for a talk with their team.   

I did not expect to wake up one morning and find myself at the centre of their advertisment campaign.
